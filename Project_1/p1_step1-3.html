    There’s no question to me that the diversity of themes and opinions is less

    online today than it was in the past. New, different, and challenging ideas get

    suppressed by today’s social networks because their ranking strategies

    prioritize the popular and habitual. (No wonder why Apple is hiring human

    editors for its news app.) But diversity is being reduced in other ways, and

    for other purposes.

    Yes, it is true that all my posts on Twitter and Facebook look something similar to a

    personal blog: They are collected in reverse-chronological order on a specific webpage, with

    direct web addresses to each post. But I have very little control over how it looks like;

    I can’t personalize it much. My page must follow a uniform look which the designers

    of the social network decide for me.

    The centralization of information also worries me because

    After my arrest, my hosting service closed my account, because I wasn’t able to pay its

    monthly fee. But at least I had a backup of all my posts in a database on my own web server.

    (Most blogging platforms used to enable you to transfer your posts and archives to your own web

    space, whereas now most platforms don’t let you so.)

    But what if my account on Facebook or Twitter is shut down for any reason? Those services

    themselves may not die any time soon, but it would be not too difficult to imagine a day

    many American services shut down accounts of anyone who is from Iran, as a result of the current

    regime of sanctions. If that happened, I might be able to download my posts in some of them,

    and let’s assume the backup can be easily imported into another platform. But what about the unique

    web address for my social network profile? Would I be able to claim it back later, after somebody

    else has possessed it? Domain names switch hands, too, but managing the process is easier and

    more clear— especially since there is a financial relationship between you and the seller which

    makes it less prone to sudden and untransparent decisions.
